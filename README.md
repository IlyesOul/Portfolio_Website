# Portfolio_Website

This is my website-version of my portfolio. I thought it'd be more useful, efficient, and enjoyable if I converted my portfolio from a 
traditional github to an interactive (programmed by yours truly) website that contains video(s) and images of the code and output of my best/favorite projects.

Just follow the intructions and enjoy!
