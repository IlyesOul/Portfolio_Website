            <p>This program is essentially bucket sort but with an array and several linked lists, as opposed to a 2D array

                So the original 0-9 array is retained, but when numbers are distributed to each of these indexes, they're appended in the form of several linked lists. This ensures that only the base necessity of space is used, and also that the lists can grow to an arbitrary length without having to duplicate themselves</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>This program uses Linked lists, arrays, user inputs, while-loops, and iterators. Again, the significant part of this program is the fact that it utilizes linked lists in order to optimize the amount of memory used</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>The average time complexity in O(n), only exceptionally being O(n^2)</p>
