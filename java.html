                    <p>This is family tree! This program essentially takes in a 2D Array of names and 'children', and contructs a LinkedList that retains the appropriate relationships between people.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>This program uses LinkedList, sets, recursion, and 2D-Arrays. While a binary tree seems intuitive, the program required two unique kinds of pointers and didn't need to be sorted</p>

                    <p>This is LL Bucketsort! The program will essentially take in a list of numbers (user-provided), and sort them using the Bucketsort algorithim. The catch is, however, that linked lists are used in combination with one array as opposed to a 2D Array!</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>This program uses Linked lists, arrays, user inputs, while-loops, and iterators. Again, the significant part of this program is the fact that it utilizes linked lists in order to optimize the amount of memory used</p>

                    <p>This is the usual Tic-Tac-Toe, but with a twist: only 'n' amount of x/o objects are allowed on the board at once, the user gets to decide how many pieces need to be in a row to win, and the user determines the dimensions of the board</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>This program uses Linked lists and custom-made Hashsets as replacements for 2D Array's, as well as objects for the X/O pieces. This program was made with the idea of optimizing space and time complexities</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>This program's time complexity is O(n), only being O(n^2) while printing</p>
