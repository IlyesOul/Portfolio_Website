                <p>Welcome to SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE!

                    This program plays out as regular Tic Tac Toe but with a twist. For every 'n' placements (decided by the user), the first placement for that player will be removed. For example, if player 'X' placed an X at some (X1, Y1), then played his fourth X when 'n' is 3, the X at (X1, Y1) would be removed.
                    
                    The user also has the power to customize how many pieces in a row it takes to win, as well as the dimensions of the row.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>This program uses LinkedList, sets, recursion, and 2D-Arrays. While a binary tree seems intuitive, the program required two unique kinds of pointers and didn't need to be sorted</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The average time complexity in O(n)</p>
